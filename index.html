          <p>Hi, I’m Carlos Andres, a web developer living in Canada. The "CA" in my portfolio name stands for both my initials and Canada, where I’m currently crafting websites — a fun little coincidence!</p>
          <p>Coming from a graphic design background, I’ve shifted my focus to front-end development, creating dynamic and visually appealing websites.</p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project was to revive the Billy Beer brand, originally made in 1977, by creating a modern, visually appealing webpage. This project was designed to showcase my skills in design and front-end development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I created 3D models of the beer cans, remade the logo, produced a promotional video, and developed a style guide for the brand.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>I began by remaking the Billy Beer logo and creating a detailed style guide to maintain consistency throughout the project. Next, I designed 3D models of the beer cans in three flavors: Light, Amber, and Regular. After completing a promotional video, I focused on the webpage, starting with research and a high-fidelity wireframe. I then styled the webpage according to the style guide, created custom animated icons, and filled in content based on my research. Finally, I applied CSS styling and added interactive features like menu animations, scroll effects, and hover effects using JavaScript.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The final product was a well-received webpage that impressed all my tutors. With comments like "overall perfect," I achieved the highest scores across all required subjects. I’m extremely proud of this project, as it successfully revived the Billy Beer brand while demonstrating my skills in design, development, and animation.</p>
